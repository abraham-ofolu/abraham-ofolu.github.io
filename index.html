          <p align="justify">Using HTML, Javascript, DS3 JS and CSS, 
								I developed a way to visualise USGS data that will allow them to better educate the public, 
								and other government organisations (and hopefully secure more funding) on issues facing our planet.</p>
							<h3>Background</h3>
							<p align="justify">The United States Geological Survey, or USGS for short, is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment, and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes.

								The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them to visualise their earthquake data. 
								They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it.

          <p align="justify">In this Project, I applied what i learned about Unsupervised learning by fitting data to a model and using clustering algorithms to place data into groups. 
            Then, I created a visualization that shares my findings.</p>

          <p>After downloading our data, we cleaned both files by removing any columns that did not provide us with any relevant information. 
            We also removed any rows that had missing data. We then used SQL to house our cleaned information within 2 tables.
            We used HTML5 and CSS to create our 3 webpages; index.html, parks.html and species.html.        
            For our nav bar and drop-down menu, we used Bootstrap and applied the same design to all 3 pages. 
            This meant all 3 of our web pages can be accessed regardless of which page you were on.            
            Javascript and Leaflet were used to create our visualisations.</p>

          <p align="justify">The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures. 
            With my knowledge of machine learning and neural networks, 
            I used the features in the provided dataset to create a binary classifier that can predict whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

            From Alphabet Soup’s business team, I have received a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. 
            Within this dataset are a number of columns that capture metadata about each organization, such as:							
            EIN and NAME—Identification columns APPLICATION_TYPE—Alphabet Soup application type AFFILIATION—Affiliated sector of industry 
            CLASSIFICATION—Government organization classification USE_CASE—Use case for funding ORGANIZATION—Organization type STATUS—Active status INCOME_AMT—Income 
            classification SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS—Special considerations for application ASK_AMT—Funding amount requested IS_SUCCESSFUL—Was the money used effectively Before You Begin</p>

            The Citi Bike Program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilisation. Each month, data is collected, organised, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage (https://citibikenyc.com/system-data).         
            analysed the chosen data to look for significant insights to report.              
            <ol>(1) How many trips have been recorded in total during the chosen period?</ol>
            <ol>(2) By what percentage has total ridership grown?</ol>
